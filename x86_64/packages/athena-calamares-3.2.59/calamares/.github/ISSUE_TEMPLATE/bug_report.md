> Hi! Thank you for helping improve Calamares. If you are seeing a problem in installing a specific distribution, you should **probably** report the problem in the distribution's bug tracker, first. That helps filter out issues with packaging, mis-configuration, etc. that Calamares has no control over. If you are a distribution packager or maintainer, this page is for you.
