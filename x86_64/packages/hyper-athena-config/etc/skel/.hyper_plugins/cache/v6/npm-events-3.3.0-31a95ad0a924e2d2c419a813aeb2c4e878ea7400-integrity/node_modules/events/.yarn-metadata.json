If you need to support very old browsers like IE8, use a shim like [`es5-shim`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es5-shim). You need both the shim and the sham versions of `es5-shim`.\n\nThis module is maintained, but only by very few people. If you'd like to help, let us know in the [Maintainer Needed](https://github.com/Gozala/events/issues/43) issue!\n\n## Install\n\nYou usually do not have to install `events` yourself! If your code runs in Node.js, `events` is built in. If your code runs in the browser, bundlers like [browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) or [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) also include the `events` module.\n\nBut if none of those apply, with npm do:\n\n```\nnpm install events\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar EventEmitter = require('events')\n\nvar ee = new EventEmitter()\nee.on('message', function (text) {\n  console.log(text)\n})\nee.emit('message', 'hello world')\n```\n\n## API\n\nSee the [Node.js EventEmitter docs][node.js docs]. `events` currently matches the Node.js 11.13.0 API.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPRs are very welcome! The main way to contribute to `events` is by porting features, bugfixes and tests from Node.js. Ideally, code contributions to this module are copy-pasted from Node.js and transpiled to ES5, rather than reimplemented from scratch. Matching the Node.js code as closely as possible makes maintenance simpler when new changes land in Node.js.\nThis module intends to provide exactly the same API as Node.js, so features that are not available in the core `events` module will not be accepted. Feature requests should instead be directed at [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node) and will be added to this module once they are implemented in Node.js.\n\nIf there is a difference in behaviour between Node.js's `events` module and this module, please open an issue!\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](./LICENSE)\n\n[node.js docs]: https://nodejs.org/dist/v11.13.0/docs/api/events.html\n",
