## initramfs module
#
# This module is specific to Debian based distros. Post installation on Debian
# the initramfs needs to be updated so as to not interrupt the boot process
# with a error about fsck.ext4 not being found.
#
## Debian specific notes
#
# If you're using live-build to build your ISO and setup the runtime env
# make sure that you purge the live-\* packages on the target system
# before running this module, since live-config dpkg-diverts update-initramfs
# and can cause all sorts of fun issues.
---
# There is only one configuration item for this module,
# the kernel to be loaded. This can have the following
# values:
#  - empty or unset, interpreted as "all"
#  - the literal string "$uname" (without quotes, with dollar),
#    which will use the output of `uname -r` to determine the
#    running kernel, and use that.
#  - any other string.
#
# Whatever is set, that string is passed as *version* argument to the
# `-k` option of *update-initramfs*. Take care that both "$uname" operates
# in the host system, and might not be correct if the target system is
# updated (to a newer kernel) as part of the installation.
#
# The default is empty/unset, leading to the behavior from Calamares
# 3.2.9 and earlier which passed "all" as version.

kernel: "all"

# Set this to true to turn off mitigations for lax file
# permissions on initramfs (which, in turn, can compromise
# your LUKS encryption keys, CVS-2019-13179).
