# imposed by other modules in the system.
requirements:
    # Amount of available disk, in GiB. Floating-point is allowed here.

    # to pass this requirement, yet have no space to install to.
    requiredStorage:    5.5

    # Amount of available RAM, in GiB. Floating-point is allowed here.
    requiredRam:        1.0
